# Custom form element "Repeatable container"

This TYPO3 extension adds a custom form element "Repeatable container" to the
TYPO3 form framework. It displays one/ a set of fields which can be duplicated
and removed if desired. Any existing validation is copied as well. All form
finishers will be aware of the copied field(s).

## Preferred installation

1. Require the extension via composer.
2. Add the site set tritum/form-element-linked-checkbox to the dependencies of 
   your site packages site set (TYPO3 v13). Or add the static TypoScript 
   configuration to your TypoScript template (TYPO3 v12 and TYPO3 v13).

## Usage

Open the TYPO3 form editor and create a new form/ open an existing one. Add a
new element to your form. The modal will list the new custom form element
"Repeatable container".

Add the desired fields with the favored validators to the "Repeatable container".

The frontend will render the "Repeatable container" as fieldset. In addition to the
included form elements it will display buttons for copying/ removing new sets of fields.

The newly implemented extended version of SaveToDatabaseFinisher can be used as seen [here](Resources/Private/ExampleFormDefinitions/extended-save-to-database-finisher.form.yaml).

## Configuration

To deactivate the copying of variants, the feature `repeatableFormElements.copyVariants` can be used

## Extendability

The following options can be used to extend the behavior when copying.

| Name             | Description                                                      |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
